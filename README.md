## starter

This is forked from Nvchad starter, and modify to my own preference.

### Pre-requisites

- Neovim 0.10 or greater
- Supported fonts for terminal icons

### Installation

neovim version >= 0.10 is required. and then run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UmmItC/starter.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

then run neovim by `nvim`. It will automatically install plugins. after that, run `:MasonInstallAll` to install all the plugins.
